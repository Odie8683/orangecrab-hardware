This guide should cover everything you need to get the example verilog project built and loaded up on the OrangeCrab.\nStep 1: Toolchain Setup  This guide will make use of the Open Source FPGA toolchain. It is possible to build and install these from scratch, but the whole process takes around 30 minutes. So it\u0026rsquo;s generally easier to simply use a nightly build from Open Tool Forge\n Grab the latest build for your platform, extract them somewhere on your PC, and add the fpga-toolchain\\bin folder to your path:\n MacOS: export PATH=[path-to-bin]:$PATH Linux: export PATH=[path-to-bin]:$PATH Windows Powershell: $ENV:PATH = \u0026quot;[path-to-bin];\u0026quot; + $ENV:PATH Windows cmd.exe: PATH=[path-to-bin];%PATH%  Check that they\u0026rsquo;ve been correctly installed by running yosys -V or nextpnr-ecp5 -V\n$ yosys -V Yosys 0.9+2406 (open-tool-forge build) (git sha1 c0bcbe1f, gcc 9.3.0-10ubuntu2 -Os) $ nextpnr-ecp5 -V nextpnr-ecp5 -- Next Generation Place and Route (Version nightly-20200707)  Note: The above steps only set the PATH variable for the current terminal session. Depending on your platform there are options to ensure the tools are kept in your path.\n  On linux based systems you may also need to add a udev rule to enable user access to the usb device, once added you\u0026rsquo;ll need to un-plug and reconnect the OrangeCrab for it to take effect\n$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/99-orangecrab.rules ATTRS{idVendor}==\u0026#34;1209\u0026#34;, ATTRS{idProduct}==\u0026#34;5af0\u0026#34;, MODE=\u0026#34;0666\u0026#34;, GROUP=\u0026#34;plugdev\u0026#34;, TAG+=\u0026#34;uaccess\u0026#34; Step 2: Verilog Example  Download the example repository.

While small in size it packs a punch! The standard version is equiped with a Lattice ECP5 FPGA, and DDR3L memory. Paired with the FPGA is a FLASH chip, with enough memory to store multiple bitstreams.\nFPGA The FPGA used on the OrangeCrab is an ECP5 from Lattice Semiconductor. The ECP5 series is a medium tier, low power, low cost FPGA product line. This device supports various DDR3 memory interfaces, because of this the board features DDR3L memory. The ECP5 is also one of the platforms that is fully supported by the Open Source Synthesis flow.\nDDR3 There is DDR3L memory attached to the FPGA. The hardware is configured by default for DDR3L (1.35V). There are enough address lines wired to the memory to support upto 8Gbit parts. (Twin-die is not supported) The standard OrangeCrab configulation makes use of 1Gbit. This is connected to the FPGA using a 16-bit data bus.\nUSB The micro usb connector is wired directly into the FPGA. Just as a microprocessor can emulate UART or SPI using standard I/O pins the FPGA can do the same for USB. By using some of the FPGA logic to create a USB core, we can use the I/O pins on the FPGA to act as a USB device. This will operate at USB 2.0 full-speed rates (12Mbit/s). Operating at High Speed rates (480Mbit/s) is not possible with the OrangeCrab hardware.\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/orangecrab-hardware/r0.1/docs/pinout/','title':"Pinout",'content':"Pinout "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/orangecrab-hardware/r0.2/docs/pinout/','title':"Pinout",'content':"Pinout  Click for larger version\n"});})();
